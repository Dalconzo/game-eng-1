Camera Switching System We should implement a runtime camera switching mechanism, allowing toggling between different camera types with key presses. This would enable quick perspective changes during gameplay or debugging.

Smooth Camera Transitions Adding interpolation between camera positions and orientations would create professional-looking transitions instead of abrupt perspective changes.

Camera Collision Detection Implementing collision detection would prevent the camera from passing through walls or objects, maintaining immersion and logical viewing angles.

Additional Camera Types Expanding our system with specialized cameras like top-down, isometric, or cinematic cameras would provide more viewing options for different game genres.

Camera Effects Pipeline A system for camera shake, zoom effects, and other visual enhancements would add polish and emotional impact to game events.

Camera Parameters Tuning Interface Creating an in-game UI for adjusting camera settings (sensitivity, speed, distance limits) would enable rapid iteration without code changes.

Camera Path System Supporting predefined camera paths would enable cinematic sequences, cutscenes, and guided tours through the game environment.
