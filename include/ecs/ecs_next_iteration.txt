# ECS System: Next Iteration Guidelines

## Current Limitations
1. Fixed maximum number of entities and components
2. No component removal implementation
3. Basic lifecycle management
4. No event system
5. No serialization support

## Next Iteration Improvements

### 1. Dynamic Entity and Component Storage
- Replace fixed arrays with dynamic containers
- Implement sparse sets for better performance
- Consider custom memory allocators for contiguous memory

### 2. Implement Component Removal
- Add complete component removal functionality
- Update entity component masks correctly
- Ensure system entity lists are updated

### 3. Enhanced Lifecycle Management  
- Add more lifecycle hooks (onEnabled, onDisabled, onDestroy)
- Implement entity/component activation/deactivation
- Add entity tags and layers

### 4. Event System Integration
- Create event dispatcher
- Allow components and systems to subscribe to events
- Implement event priorities

### 5. Serialization Support
- Add serialization/deserialization of entities and components
- Support for scene saving/loading
- Runtime prefab instantiation

### 6. Performance Optimizations
- Implement archetype-based storage for better cache coherence
- Add parallel system execution
- Optimize entity/component lookups
